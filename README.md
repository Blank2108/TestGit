# AndroidEbookReader
## An Android-based reading system. 
This reader integrates many functions such as local file reading, online reading, user interest recording, and intelligent recommendation. Specifically, we use BufferedReader for reading txt file and use Browser/Server architecture for online reading. In addition, we adopt Sax for parsing xml file and use frequency based algorithm for recording user habit. This application can meet the demand of daily reading and could analysis user's habits simply. Since that user's interest is protean and personalized reading is heavy demanded, this application can be quickly lunched and used for users who on and off duty or recess, especially for young e.g. college students who have large demand for various reading subjects, like classics, news, jokes, and chicken soup.
